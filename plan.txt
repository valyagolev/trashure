final steps:

1. adjust plowing speed:
        Plower must be slower
        Recycler must clear out in front of it a bit faster (maybe do it by adjusting radar shape)

2. show list of machines

3. highlight taken floor when building a machine

4. DONE refactor radar consupmtion

5. DONE machine names

6. "bulding in progress" mechanics

7. "fuel" mechanics

8. "maintenance" mechanics

9. tutorial

----

10. radar looks??

========================



1. DONE. fix the "a" value for the flying voxel!


1. DONE Fix the voxel spawning algo, they spawn too far away from where they originate
    it interferes with the speed of clearing up, we need to get that fixed

2. adjust radar "cone", change it to much narrower :-(

3. probably adjust the radar to take several voxels at a time
    we want to clear enough for another car (~12x12? make it smaller?) quickly, and then it should get slow. maybe use a specific function with this shape


4. DONE let's have "red" as "golden", stop spawning it in the beginning

---

5. DONE make a component to make Scenes inherit render layers
6. make a list of buildings

game stages:

5. DONE you build a "Plower" to send more stuff in the way of the Recycler
6. "Plower" has to move when it can (and update forbidden columns)

6. - "Plower" needs "red" maintenance, so you send it back
7. - then you wanna build something to send it to the "Plower" ("Relay"?)

8. as a different plot, "Recycler" won't throw away stuff when it's clogged, so you make another Plower to clear it out

9. make it all into a tutorial?


more:

visuals/ui:
1. redo radars? custom shader? ;-)
2. add "input" and "output" empties to the machine models
3. move camera on mouse near edge
4. list of your buildings to come back to them
5. building "states" as in clogged/needs maintenance/waits for fuel...
6. FAILED. remodel mesh (doesn't help)

nice to have
2. DONE. investigate why we run in 30fps (vsync on my screen)

refactorings (probably useless)
1. events instead of voxelmailbox?
2. use SceneInstanceReady instead of guessing systems
3. investigate Archetypes...

4. ignore events when "egui wants mouse/keyboard"

5. turn on "ambiguity detector"
    https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/schedule/struct.ScheduleBuildSettings.html#structfield.ambiguity_detection
6. show/hide dbg stuff on a button?
