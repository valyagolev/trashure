1. Fix the voxel spawning algo, they spawn too far away from where they originate
2. it interferes with the speed of clearing up, we need to get that fixed
3. probably adjust the radar to take several voxels at a time
    we want to clear the initial stuff quickly, and then it should get slow. maybe use a specific function with this shape


4. let's have "red" as "golden", stop spawning it in the beginning


game stages:

5. - you build a "Plower" to send more stuff in the way of the Recycler

6. - "Plower" needs "red" maintenance, so you send it back
7. - then you wanna build something to send it to the "Plower" ("Relay"?)

8. as a different plot, "Recycler" won't throw away stuff when it's clogged, so you make another Plower to clear it out

9. make it all into a tutorial?


more:

visuals/ui:
1. redo radars? custom shader? ;-)
2. add "input" and "output" empties to the machine models
3. move camera on mouse near edge
4. list of your buildings to come back to them
5. building "states" as in clogged/needs maintenance/waits for fuel...
6. remodel stuff

nice to have
1. fix the "a" value for the flying voxel
2. investigate why we run in 30fps

refactorings (probably useless)
1. events instead of voxelmailbox?
2. use SceneInstanceReady instead of guessing systems
3. investigate Archetypes...
4. ignore events when "egui wants mouse/keyboard"
5. turn on "ambiguity detector"
6. show/hide dbg stuff on a button?
