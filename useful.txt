for next time:
- figure out automated itch uploads
- figure out saving menu into text file or something
- start with more granular schedules to add menu more easily
- don't use Esc key so it works with itch fullscreen
- try to start with a specific palette, always helpful

and in code
- find a library for color mixing
- think about the linting idea (this component requires that, etc)
